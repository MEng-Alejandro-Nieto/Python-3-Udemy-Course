''' Pypy is a repository for open-source third-party packages.
it's similar to RubyGems  int the Ruby World PHP's Packagist, 
CPAN for Perl, and NPM for Node.js

* so far we have been only used libraries that come internally with python
* there are many otherlibraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on Pypi.
* we can use pip install at the command line to install these packages


in the comman line type "pip install {package_name}"
for example: google "python package for excel"
you will find many packages, but lets try one called "openpyxl"
